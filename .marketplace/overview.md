# SpecFlow - Cucumber for .NET

**Check out our [quick introduction guide](http://www.specflow.org/getting-started/) and the [documentation for the Visual Studio integration](http://specflow.org/documentation/Visual-Studio-Integration/).**

SpecFlow bridges the communication gap between domain experts and developers by binding business readable behavior specifications and examples to the underlying implementation.

Our mission is to provide a pragmatic and frictionless approach to [Specification-By-Example](https://www.specificationbyexample.com/) for .NET projects. SpecFlow is open source and provided under a [BSD license](https://go.specflow.org/license). 

SpecFlow also supports the concepts of Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD), which are often used synonymously with Specification-By-Example.
